Swift enums should allow default associated values

## Summary:
Like function parameters, it would be useful to be able to provide defaults for associated values in enums.

This would allow parameters with defaults to be omitted when passing those cases.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open EnumDefaultAssociatedValues.playground

## Expected Results:
No compiler error is shown.

## Actual Results:
A compiler error "Default argument not permitted in tuple type" is shown.

## Version:
Version 7.0 (7A220)
